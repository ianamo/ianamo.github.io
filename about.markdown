Ian Mosley is a husband, father, and developer. He comes to this world from the world of K-12 education, where for over a decade he taught Latin and logic to youngsters. It was great practice in boiling down complex ideas as simply as possible. He loves writing, coffee, running, and reading, and resides in northwest Arkansas with his wife and son.

This is the base Jekyll theme.
