Check out some of my development projects!

- [Micron-Blog](https://github.com/ianamo/micron-blog) a full-stack MERN app for setting up a micro-blog in the spirit of the early days of Twitter. Does not implement authentication, so not really usable as a public website, but demonstrates REST API concepts and their integration into the state of a React app. Components styled with Material-UI. Not currently hosted -- the link is to the repository's source code.
- [Anagrab](https://busy-erin-macaw-fez.cyclic.app/) a word game where you make anagrams. Written in JS with a backend using Express and Node. Featured on Cyclic.sh's developer office hour.
- [Synth Lab](https://ianamo.github.io/csb-4vcgbm/) this React app lets you tap into the Tone.js library to create synthesized sounds. You can even record the notes to make melodies.
- [Just Pick One!](https://keen-gelato-586da9.netlify.app/) this simple React app is perfect for the indecisive. Just plug in the options you have to choose from, and the app picks for you!
- [Crypto Keyboard](https://ianamo.github.io/old-portfolio/cryptography/index.html) impress your friends and confound your enemies with this JS keyboard that will create and decode text using the ROT13 cipher.
- [Treble Tutor](https://ianamo.github.io/old-portfolio/treble-tutor/index.html) this site will help you learn your treble clef.
