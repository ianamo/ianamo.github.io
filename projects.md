Check out some of my development projects!

- [Alexandria](https://superb-sable-476bca.netlify.app/) a full-stack MERN app for recording books in a database by their ISBNs. Backend API is written in NodeJS and hosed via Heroku and writing to a Mongo cloud database. Frontend is in React. Books can be added by ISBN, and users can be added to the DB via Google authentication. You can add books to your library once logged in, and request loans from other users.
- [Chronicler](https://github.com/ianamo/chronicler) Chronicler is a node.js web scraper used to create a database of facts within given years from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/). 
- [The Year You Were Born](https://ianamo.github.io/year-you-were-born/) a fun website to give you random facts from the year you were born.
- [Micron-Blog](https://github.com/ianamo/micron-blog) a full-stack MERN app for setting up a micro-blog in the spirit of the early days of Twitter. Does not implement authentication, so not really usable as a public website, but demonstrates REST API concepts and their integration into the state of a React app. Components styled with Material-UI. Not currently hosted -- the link is to the repository's source code.
- [Anagrab](https://busy-erin-macaw-fez.cyclic.app/) a word game where you make anagrams. Written in JS with a backend using Express and Node. Featured on Cyclic.sh's developer office hour.
- [Synth Lab](https://ianamo.github.io/csb-4vcgbm/) this React app lets you tap into the Tone.js library to create synthesized sounds. You can even record the notes to make melodies.
- [Just Pick One!](https://keen-gelato-586da9.netlify.app/) this simple React app is perfect for the indecisive. Just plug in the options you have to choose from, and the app picks for you!
- [Crypto Keyboard](https://ianamo.github.io/old-portfolio/cryptography/index.html) impress your friends and confound your enemies with this JS keyboard that will create and decode text using the ROT13 cipher.
- [Treble Tutor](https://ianamo.github.io/old-portfolio/treble-tutor/index.html) this site will help you learn your treble clef.
